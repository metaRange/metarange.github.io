The node editor represent one time step of the simulation.
Below the node editor, you can see and copy the code that is generated based on the node configuration.


Drag menu items to the canvas to add nodes.
Drag node output to another node input to connect them (works only if they have if they have the same type).


Species nodes can be connected to traits and trait nodes to processes nodes.
Each trait node has an option to set its initial value (i.e. at the start of the simulation).
The trait values are propagated to the connected process nodes and transformed by them.


At the end of the time step (when a trait is not connected to any more process nodes), its values are propagated to the species node for the next time step.

:::note
This editor is only meant to give you an idea of how a simulation can be set up.

The package has many options that are not available in the editor, so feel free to browse the documentation (or the published papers) to see what is possible.
